# TFLite Examples Repo

Flask Server in `server/`, examples in `examples`. A work in progress.

`pipenv run deps` once (grabs dependencies), `pipenv run build` to rebuild the examples and protobuf files after that. `pipenv run run` to run.
Run the Flask Server with `pipenv run python -m server` or just `./server/__main__.py` if you've got the right python version/dependencies installed.
