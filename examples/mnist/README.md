# Example: Training MNIST

This example is directly borrowed from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/3fe65db5673477c84faf52467b39f99673c86879/mnist).

For comparison, a hosted example of the original is available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-examples/mnist/dist/index.html).

The version present in this repo currently runs training in the browser using Tensorflow.js but runs validation (the images shown on the example's page) against a static pre-trained model running in a TensorFlow Lite interpreter running on the server.
